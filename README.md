# Vehicle-Traffic-Control

I have developed a C++ software application called Vehicle Traffic Control, which captures live video streams from IP cameras and analyzes traffic using OpenCV. The application detects and counts vehicles in real time, helping estimate traffic density and pollution levels across different streets.

•Core Features and Workflow:

✓Video Capture & Processing: The application uses OpenCV to process live video feeds from IP cameras and detect vehicles using a trained dataset model.

✓Traffic-Based Pollution Estimation: By counting vehicles, the users can estimate which streets are more polluted due to traffic congestion.

✓Map Visualization: The map view displays the geographic positions of the cameras.

•Data Logging: Every 10 seconds, the application updates a SQLite database with:

✓Vehicle count

✓Latitude and longitude of the camera's position on the map.

✓Street name

✓District-level pollution indicator

•Technologies Used:

✓C++17: Core language for application logic

✓OpenCV: For image processing and vehicle detection

✓Qt5 (Widgets, WebEngineWidgets, Sql): For GUI design, map rendering, and database integration

✓SQLite: Lightweight, portable database for storing traffic data.

✓CMake: Build system configuration.

•Map Integration:

✓Offline Maps: Implemented using tile maps generated by Mobile Atlas Creator

✓Online Maps: Integrated via OpenStreetMap using Qt WebEngine
